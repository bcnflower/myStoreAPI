# Store API Using Sequelize and GraphQL 
I created this project to learn modern API building technologies like ORM (Object Relational Mapping).
## DB related config.
All database based config is inside **sequelize/index.js** 

## Populate Database
To populate database with dummy data run
```bash
> node db-populate/index.js
```

## Run API Server
To run API server run.
```bash
> node server
Server is running on localhost:4001
```
Open URL in browser to query your API inside browser.
